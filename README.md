DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2020.3002078


This version is modified to enable the Phase 1 and Phase 2 separately, when BM is set as 1, the results are of the whole procedure. otherwise the results are of phase one only.
Also this version is modified to enable the global boundary marching and local boundary marching separately. If the parameter of LBM in mex_WSGL.cpp is set as 1, the local boundary marching is enabled.

The version of Matlab we used is 2015b, the version of OpenCV we used is 2.4.9
